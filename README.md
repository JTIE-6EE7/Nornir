## Nornir scripts

Misc Nornir utility scripts:

* grab_info: executes a list of show commands and saves the output to file

* graboid_worm: like grab_info but uses CDP to find other hosts

* vlan_mapper: maps VLANs from old to new based on CSV file contents

* reloader: scripts to schedule a reload in 60 minutes and cancel the reload
